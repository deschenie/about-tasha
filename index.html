    <p>I am currently enrolled in the Deep Dive Coding bootcamp for Fullstack Web Development.</p>
    <p>I worked as a Computer Lab Technician and studied Fine Art in the past.</p>
    <p>I am from New Mexico.</p>
    <p>When I was a child, I used to say I was from Madagascar.
    <p>My first doctorate was in Venomology, prompted after watching the best cinematic saga to ever be created; <strong>Twilight</strong>.</p>
    <p>One of my favorite past times include speed chess in addition to extreme ironing.</p>
    <p>What can I say, I like to <strong>party</strong>!!</p>
